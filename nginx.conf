    # Backend API Proxy
    # In Docker Compose, the backend service is usually accessible by its service name.
    # Since we are moving to a Python backend which runs on port 8000.
    # Assuming the python backend runs in the same container or a linked container named 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' if using host networking,
    # or a specific service name if using docker-compose. 
    # Since the user seems to run everything in one go or via docker-compose where backend is separate?
    # Let's assume standard localhost for now as per previous context, or 'backend' service name if it was docker-compose.
    # However, the user's previous setup had them in separate processes.
    # If this nginx is inside a container, it needs to point to the backend container or process.
